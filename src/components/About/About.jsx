          Hi, my name is Christopher — a Full Stack Engineer with a passion for
          building meaningful health and wellness experiences through
          technology. With over 12 years of experience as a personal trainer and
          coach, including running my own fitness and nutrition business, I
          bring a unique blend of real-world insight and technical skill to
          every project. Whether I’m crafting clean, user-friendly frontends or
          architecting robust backend systems, I thrive on helping people level
          up their lives — digitally and physically.
